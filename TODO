BUGS:
  ☐ [gatsby-transformer-sharp] The "fixed" and "fluid" resolvers are now deprecated. Switch to "gatsby-plugin-image" for better performance and a simpler API. See https://gatsby.dev/migrate-images to learn how.
  ☐ GET http://localhost:8000/static/89031fcd6d664e25838b7de6532f943a/ee604/paint.png 404 (Not Found)
  ☐ Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function.
