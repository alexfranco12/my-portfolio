Desktop:
  ☐ slow down PORTFOLIO on landing page
  ☐ take a look at capatilization
    - particularly "hello" "my" and "alex"
  ☐ list my skills in a more deliberate fashion

   

Mobile:
  ☐ gradient on projects listing is harsh

BUGS:
  ☐ [gatsby-transformer-sharp] The "fixed" and "fluid" resolvers are now deprecated. Switch to "gatsby-plugin-image" for better performance and a simpler API. See https://gatsby.dev/migrate-images to learn how.
